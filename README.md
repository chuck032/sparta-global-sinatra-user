For this project I was required to create a user object using Sinatra. We had to use MVC(Models, Views, Controllers), more specifically views and controllers to accomplish this.

Features which we had to include:

* User information should include
  * email

* Controller that has functional get commands:
  * index
  * new
  * show
  * edit
